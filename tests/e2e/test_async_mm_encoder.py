"""PR #1015 e2e test — async MM encoder wiring through SpyreMultiprocExecutor.

Boots a real vLLM `LLM` with the async MM encoder enabled and the
nano-gv model (a random-init ~16 MB granite-vision variant built by
`tools/build_nano_gv.py`) then drives one MM request through the full
stack:

    request → scheduler emits encode job → SpyreMultiprocExecutor submits
    to encoder subprocess → encoder writes embedding to SHM → workers read
    SHM via collective_rpc → scheduler unblocks prefill → decode completes.

This is the only test that exercises the executor → encoder-process →
worker handshake end-to-end, with all four real processes (engine, two TP
workers, encoder). The unit tests for findings 1-3 stub at the executor
boundary; the wiring (queue creation, READY handshake, scheduler /
executor binding, collective_rpc store_mm_embeddings) only runs here.

Runs on CPU in eager mode against the nano-gv fixture (see
`REFERENCE_MODELS["joerunde/nano-gv"]` in tests/spyre_util.py), so
warmup takes ~2 s instead of ~2 min. No Spyre hardware needed.

#
# Notable knobs:
#   - VLLM_WORKER_MULTIPROC_METHOD=spawn — vLLM defaults to fork, which
#     SIGSEGVs on macOS when the MM stack pulls in tvm_ffi (via xgrammar).
#   - SENDNN_INFERENCE_TP_MM_SHARING=0 — disables the rank-0 → all-ranks
#     SHM-broadcast embedding share path. Its torch.distributed.broadcast
#     collective hangs during warmup with TP > 1 on macOS (pre-existing
#     bug, not in scope for this test). The async encoder uses a different
#     SHM path (collective_rpc store_mm_embeddings), so disabling sharing
#     here only affects warmup encoding — the async encoder takes over
#     after warmup completes.
#   - VLLM_ENABLE_V1_MULTIPROCESSING=0 from _local_envs_for_test.sh is left
#     intact. It controls the engine-core IPC (in-process vs out-of-process),
#     NOT worker TP — the existing TP=2 tests rely on it staying off.
