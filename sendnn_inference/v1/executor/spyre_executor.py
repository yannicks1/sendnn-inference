"""SpyreMultiprocExecutor — extends vLLM's MultiprocExecutor with an
async MM encoder subprocess.

vLLM spawns worker processes as daemon processes, which means workers
cannot themselves spawn child processes.  By starting the encoder process
here (from the non-daemon executor), we sidestep that restriction.

The executor owns the job/result queues:

- submit jobs from ``_spyre_mm_encode_requests`` in each execute_model call
- collect completed (req_id, shape, dtype) metadata from the result queue
- broadcast metadata to all TP workers via ``collective_rpc("store_mm_embeddings")``
  so each worker reads the embedding from SHM independently — no rank-0
  tensor broadcast needed
- unlink SHM blocks after collective_rpc returns (all workers have read)
