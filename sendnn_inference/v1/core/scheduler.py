    Chunked-Prefill Scheduling policy

    The prefill vs. decode priority policy is the following:
        - Current prefill request priority: A new request cannot start prefill
           while another request's prefill is on-going

        - Prefill step interleaving: The prefill steps are interleaved with
            one decode step: as long as there are decoding requests, two
            prefill steps cannot be consecutive

        - General prefill priority: conditioned on interleaving constraint,
            prefill has priority over decode

        - No empty step: if a prefill step is prevented because it doesn't
            satisfy Spyre's specific constraints, a decode step is scheduled

    Spyre scheduling constraints:

        - Prefill batch size: prefill batch is of size 1, only one request's
            chunked prefill can be scheduled at a time

        - Decode batch size: cannot have more than max_num_seqs running
            requests, including prefill and decode

        Note: all the remaining constraints need to be satisfied at the time
            of scheduling the last chunk of a chunked prefill

        - Volumetric constraint: the product of batch_size and current TKV
            must not exceed `VLLM_DT_MAX_BATCH_TKV_LIMIT` when adding a new
            request. See `_can_decode_all_requests()` method for details.

        - Decode pausing: requests may be temporarily paused from decoding
            when the batch TKV limit would be exceeded in the next decode step.
            Paused requests are resumed when capacity becomes available.
